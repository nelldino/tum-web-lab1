        <h2>Studies</h2>
        <p><b>Bachelor Degree in Software Engineering (2022-Present)</b>, Technical University of Moldova <br><br>
           My favourite course of all time was the Philosophy and Critical Thinking one. First of all, the best teacher ever, enjoyed his classes a lot and the readings that he gave us. It really changed the way I look and read books now.

           <b>High-School Diploma</b>, IPLT "Nicolae Iorga" (School Year 2022)
           I am thankful for my highschool year, because I prioritised my studying and this is how I started to enjoy chemistry and especially physics, whichl later on was and still is useful for my current studies.
